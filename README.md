# Photo Sorter
Tired of manually sorting pictures from phones, cameras, and old backups? This simple Python script was built to help automate the process of finding duplicate images, removing them, and organizing photos into timeline-based folders.

I created this tool as a learning project to get better at Python while solving a common issue. There are probably many similar scripts out there, but this one is my contribution to make photo management a bit easier. I hope it helps others as well!

Feel free to copy, use, and improve the code. If you make any improvements, I'd love to hear about them!

Use this script at your own risk. It has the ability to delete duplicate photos, and mistakes could lead to accidental data loss. I am not responsible for any damage or loss of data that may result from using this code.
